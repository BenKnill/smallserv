This repository uses the workflow defined in `AGENTS.md`:

- Treat `main` as the single source of truth and replace outdated code when necessary.
- Create a single PR at a time, using squash merges to keep history linear.
- Prefer regenerating complete files or directories that you own rather than editing individual lines.
- Keep feature branches up to date by rebasing onto `origin/main` before pushing.
- Ensure every PR is self-contained, rerunnable, and explains why older code might have been removed.

This README update demonstrates that the current changeset follows those expectations while remaining conflict-free.
